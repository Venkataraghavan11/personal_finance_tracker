# personal_finance_tracker
  In this python django project, we will create an expense tracker that will take details of our expenses. While filling the signup form a person will also need to fill in the details about the income and the amount he/she wants to save. Some people earn on a daily basis, so their income can also be added on a regular basis. Details of expenses will be shown in the form of a pie chart on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Installation of django is a must to start with the Expense Tracker project.
